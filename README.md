# React Challenge

This challenge consisted of building Superhero cards using React.

## Force error page

Since no actual API was used to build this form, a mocked server error page can be triggered by setting the first name value to `forceError`

## Run it locally

To run the project locally you need to first clone the git repository running the following command on your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/thomcitrus/react-superhero.git`

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer, then once you're located in the newly created directory run the following commands to install the necessary packages and run the development server:


npm install
npm run dev


You should be able to visit the local server at `localhost:3000`
